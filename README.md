# I'm an apprentice of the way of Christ and a student of the Bible [(John 14:6)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A6&version=ESV).
I'm currently learning about the practice of the unhurried life, disciplined by Christ's examples. i.e., I desire to practice a daily life without hurry. Busyness is not the issue, hurriedness is. [For example, Jesus waits 2 days before attending to Lazarus, his dear friend who is close to death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A1-44&version=ESV). [He also spends prolonged time alone in the wilderness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A1-11&version=ESV). [He is inturrupted on his way to heal a child (as prompted by her father) by another woman that seeks him out](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+5%3A21-43&version=ESV). Jesus' schedule was busy in the gospels, filled to the brim, essentially. He was busy, but he was not hurried.

### I like what Tim Keller says about `meditation`:
> Persons who meditate become people of substance who
have thought things out and have deep convictions, who
can explain difficult concepts in simple language, and who
have good reasons behind everything they do. Many
people do not meditate. They skim everything, picking
and choosing on impulse, having no thought-out reasons
for their behavior. Following whims, they live shallow
lives.
