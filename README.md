# I'm an apprentice of the way of Christ and a student of the Bible [(John 14:6)](https://www.esv.org/John+14+6/). As a layman, I'm deeply interested in Christian apologetics.
In addition, I'm currently learning about the practice of the unhurried life, disciplined by Christ's examples. i.e., I desire to practice a daily life without hurry. Busyness is not the issue, hurriedness is. [For example, Jesus waits 2 days before attending to Lazarus, his dear friend who is close to death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A1-44&version=ESV). [He also spends prolonged time alone in the wilderness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A1-11&version=ESV). [He is inturrupted on his way to heal a child (as prompted by her father) by another woman that seeks him out](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+5%3A21-43&version=ESV). Jesus' schedule was busy in the gospels, filled to the brim, essentially. He was busy, but he was not hurried. If something is worth doing then it may be worth not hurrying it.

So far, this has been a really big challenge for me. As someone that works constantly on the computer in a full time capacity, it's hard not to flip through
browser tabs or check some form of social media every five minutes. The need to always be connected or engaged in something is tempting for some reason that I
don't understand and can't really describe. However, I do know that for me it is mentally exhausting and quickly surpasses a thin threshold where it becomes unrewarding. There's certainly use to be found in social media, like staying informed with the news or checking in with friends. But I'm someone who allows himself to easily be consumed with what is available, and that is the problem.

### I like what Tim Keller says about `meditation`:
> Persons who meditate become people of substance who
have thought things out and have deep convictions, who
can explain difficult concepts in simple language, and who
have good reasons behind everything they do. Many
people do not meditate. They skim everything, picking
and choosing on impulse, having no thought-out reasons
for their behavior. Following whims, they live shallow
lives.

*A lot of the above is inspired by John Mark Comer's Ruthless Elimination of Hurry. I also really like The Wisdom Pyramid by
Bret McCracken and Deep Work by Cal Newport.*
